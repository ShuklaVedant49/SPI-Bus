# SPI-Serial-Peripheral-Interface
-The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other over short distances.   
-SPI is a full-duplex protocol, which means that data can be transmitted and received simultaneously

What's Inside This Folder?
1) SPI_Design 
-The design of SPI bus is made using Verilog,SystemVerilog
2) SPI_TestBench
-The meticulously crafted SystemVerilog test bench employs robust verification techniques, including constraint-based random verification and assertion-based verification, to thoroughly scrutinize the design under test and ensure its adherence to the design specifications.
3) SPI_Design_4
-The master device in this design interacts with four separate slaves, each assigned a distinct address.
