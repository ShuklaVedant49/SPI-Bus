-SPI is a full-duplex protocol, which means that data can be transmitted and received simultaneously

What's Inside This Folder?
1) SPI_Design
-The design of SPI bus is made using Verilog,SystemVerilog
2)SPI_TestBench
-Test Bench is designed using SystemVerilog Architecture, different methods of SV(SystemVerilog) like Constraint random verification, Assertion based verification is being used.
